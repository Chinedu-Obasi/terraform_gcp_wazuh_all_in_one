Step 1: Create a New Google Cloud Project
    1. Go to the GCP Console:
        ◦ Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
    2. Select or Create a New Project:
        ◦ In the top-left corner, click on the project selector drop-down.
        ◦ Click on New Project.
        ◦ Give your project a name (e.g., wazuh-deployment) and select your Billing Account (if you already have one).
        ◦ Optionally, choose a location for the project, then click Create.
    3. Enable Billing for the Project:
        ◦ After the project is created, navigate to the Billing Page to ensure that billing is enabled for the project.
        ◦ If prompted, choose the Free Tier option, if available.

Step 2: Enable the Required APIs
    1. Enable Compute Engine API:
        ◦ In the GCP Console, navigate to the API & Services > Library.
        ◦ Search for Compute Engine API.
        ◦ Click on it, and then click Enable.
    2. Enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) API:
        ◦ Similarly, search for IAM API.
        ◦ Click on it, and then click Enable.
    3. Enable Cloud Resource Manager API:
        ◦ Search for Cloud Resource Manager API.
        ◦ Click on it, and then click Enable.

Step 3: Create a Service Account
    1. Navigate to the IAM & Admin Section:
        ◦ Go to the IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.
        ◦ Make sure your newly created project is selected.
    2. Create a New Service Account:
        ◦ Click + CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT.
        ◦ Give the service account a name (e.g., terraform-sa) and an optional description.
        ◦ Click Create and Continue.

    3. Grant Permissions to the Service Account:
        ◦ In the "Grant this service account access to project" step, you’ll need to assign the appropriate roles to allow Terraform to manage resources in your GCP project.
            ▪ Add the following roles:
                • Editor (provides full access to all resources)
                • Viewer (provides read-only access to resources)
                • Service Account User (allows the service account to act as other service accounts)
        ◦ Click Continue.
    4. Skip the User Permissions:
        ◦ Click Done after the permissions are assigned (no need to grant users access to this service account).

Step 4: Create and Download a Service Account Key
    1. Select the Newly Created Service Account:
        ◦ Find the service account you just created (e.g., terraform-sa) in the list of service accounts.
        ◦ Click on it.
    2. Create a Key for the Service Account:
        ◦ In the service account details page, click the Keys tab.
        ◦ Click ADD KEY > Create new key.
        ◦ Choose JSON format and click Create.
        ◦ The JSON key file will be automatically downloaded to your computer. This file contains the credentials that Terraform will use to interact with your GCP project.
       Important: Store this key file securely, as it provides access to your GCP project.

Step 5: Use the Service Account Key in Terraform
Now that you have the service account JSON key, you can configure Terraform to use it:
    1. Move the JSON Key File:
        ◦ Place the downloaded JSON key file in a secure directory, for example: /path/to/your/credentials.json
